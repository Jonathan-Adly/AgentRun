We would love for you to contribute to `AgentRun`.

We use pytest to test and benchmark the code and Mkdocs for documentation. Here is a good overview of the process:

1. Create a virtual environment for the AgentRun project.

```bash
cd agentrun
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Test the code before starting

```bash
pytest --cov=agentrun/
```

3. Create a feature branch 
```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

4. Add your code and test it again

5. Update the documentation under the docs/
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

6. Submit a PR for review
